Being nervous is completely normal. It is part of the uncomfort due to pushing youself outside your comfort zone.
That is completely normal and you can counter-act it by investing more time/work as the quarter progresses.

Good job on the log reflection assignement and your own log organization. I especially like the week seperators. 
I also like how you broke the log by day and number of hours. Keep in mind that as the quarter progresses, 15-20 hours are expected spread over 5-6 days of the week.
Overall, good job!
