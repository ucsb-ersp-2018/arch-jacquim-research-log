**Tuesday, Oct 1 (1.5 hrs)**

* Set up log
* ERSP initial thoughts
* Log reflection

*ERSP Initial Thoughts*
1. This is what I'm most excited about in ERSP:

I'm most excited to learn the process of research and work in a team to develop a project. I'm looking forward to learning a new subject and, at the same time, apply it to a specific problem. While I'm relatively new to computer science in general, I feel like I've spent a long time on foundational material without actually applying it in a meaningful setting. It's exciting to think about how I'll be collecting real information and learning how to write an academic engineering paper. I think, with ERSP, I'll feel more experienced and confident about my ability to contribute to the tech world.

2. This is what I'm most nervous about in ERSP:

I don't have any experience in computer architecture, and I'm worried I'll have to struggle to keep up when I'm introduced to these new topics. Research in general seems like an intimidating and cryptic process, so while I'm excited to have the opportunity to unravel it, I'm also concerned that I won't work well enough to support the rest of my team members.

*Log Reflection*
1. How did the logs differ in style? What advantages are there in one style over another?

In terms of layout, Miranda Parker's log was definitely a lot more advanced (expecially the organized intro with important links at the top), while Adrian Mendoza's was more basic and linear. They both had a similar format, however, starting each week with a list of goals and discussing what they accomplished every day. Jessica's writing was very casual, while Adrian's was more concise. I think Jessica's style has some advantages in that she presents a very clear summary of the project up front with some of the material that was important to the project,and her writing style was very readable. Adrian's is less 'flashy' but, since it was done as part of an ERSP project as well, seems more familiar. It's also interesting to see his progress in research and the ERSP program itself over the course of his log.

2. How  were the logs useful to the researcher and those working with the researcher?

The logs both kept very careful track of what the researcher did that day, where they found the data, and who they worked with that day. Obviously, these records are useful to the researcher because they have an opportunity to review their work and determine if they're making adequate progress. (The "Goals" section each week seems especially important for keeping them on track.) Those who are working with the researcher can read these logs to get a good idea of what problems they've been targeting and what skills they have. The logs could also be useful for catching up on each others' work if the group doesn't meet for a day or two.

3. Did the students keeping the logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?

I definitely feel like keeping the logs helped the students stay focused: listing their goals each week and tracking their own progress everyday seemed to help them determine whether they were doing enough to stay on top of their projects. From the two example logs I read, it seemed like the students pretty much always accomplished what they set out to do each week, but they started setting more ambitious goals for themselves over time.

4. Anything else to say about logs?

I really liked reading Miranda Parker's log- it's full of so much cool information but it's also really personable and casual. It seemed like she enjoyed her work. Adrian's was very helpful, since it gave me an idea of the scale and workload of the ERSP projects.
