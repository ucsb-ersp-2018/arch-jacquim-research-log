*ERSP Initial Thoughts*
1. This is what I'm most excited about in ERSP:

I'm most excited to learn the process of research and work in a team to develop a project. I'm looking forward to learning a new subject and, at the same time, apply it to a specific problem.

2. This is what I'm most nervous about in ERSP:

I don't have any experience in computer architecture, and I'm worried I'll have to struggle to keep up when I'm introduced to these new topics.

*Log Reflection*
1. How did the logs differ in style? What advantages are there in one style over another?
2. How were the logs useful to the researcher and those working with the researcher?
3. Did the students keeping the logs seem to meet their goals? Did they get better at meeting their goals over time?
